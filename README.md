<h4> Hay Folks!!,
  This repository consists of the Python code I made during the <B><u><a href="https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk00pH9R9bep3COyYcLvfL9HjDPSzyw%3A1590734709271&ei=da_QXq2UEIf0rQHpo5CoAw&q=what+is+foobar+challenge&oq=what+is+foobar&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgCMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgAEEc6BAgjECc6BQgAEIsDOgQIABBDOgoIABCDARBDEIsDOgcIIxDqAhAnOgcIABBDEIsDOgcIABAKEIsDOggIABCRAhCLAzoHCAAQFBCHAjoICAAQgwEQiwM6BQgAEJECOgQIABAKUML7IljUtSNg7c4jaARwA3gEgAHrAogB0imSAQYyLTE3LjOYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEKuAEC&sclient=psy-ab">FOOBAR CHALLENGE</a></u></b>. I had also given a brief idea about the approch and algorithm I used in those questions.</h4>

  <p>        This was the very first question I encountered in the <B><u>FOOBAR CHALLENGE</u></b>, and it deals with prime numbers. From the word prime number the thing that came to my  mind was the <b><u><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/">Sieve of Eratosthenes<a></u></b> and I used it for the question. Since the constraints of this problem is relatively low(about 1e5) , one can also use bruteforce for the solution.</p>

     <p>This problem was intituative demands logical thinking. The optimum answer will be Fibonacci(for max) and power of 2(for min).</p>

     <p>This problem was very confusing and consumed a lot of my time. The problem states a defination for <b>Lucky Triples</b> and ask you to find total number of lucky triples in a given array. "<b>The Lucky Triple need not to be unique</b>" this line wa smissing in the problem statement which made me think in a diffrent way to eliminate the duplicate whict was not necessary.</p>

     <p>This was an intuitive problem which  required loggical reasoning. I used approch similar to <b>Euler's Theorem for GCD</b> to get  my worked done in this problem. </p>

     <p>This was a problem based of Graph Data Structure. The problem statement comesup with an idea of a 0-1 maze in which. I used BFS to find my way out of the maze and also a function to change the position of walls one at a time.</p>

     <p>This problem deals with a directed graph.Since it a Directed graph, the word that ring my ears was DFS and I used it for the problem. It too me 1 day to come up with a proper solution because graph data structure was new to me.</p>

     <p>This was the <b>Hardest problem</b> of the challenge according to me. The problem is a combination of <b><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/travelling-salesman-problem-set-1/">Travelling Salesman problem</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-dp-23/">Bellman-Ford Algorithm</a></b> . As I was new to graph and didn't know these alogorithms well, it took be a lot of days to comeup with a proper answer. I also searched the problem on google to solve it , hence i don't take the credit to solve it by my self.</p>

     <p>After 3 problems on Graph, this problem was on Mathematics. The problem asks you to write a function that returns the  value
	  </p>
	  <p>floor(1*sqrt(2))+floor(2*sqrt(2))+floor(3*sqrt(2))+....................floor(n*sqrt(2))</p>
	  <p>At first glance, it seemed very easy to me(iterrative approach) ,but the constraints were too high(1e100) for iterration.Soon i found and <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2052179/how-to-find-sum-i-1n-left-lfloor-i-sqrt2-right-rfloor-a001951-a-beatty-s">article</a> which states a thorem which may help in solving the problem. Moreover we need sqare root of 2 till 100 place(which is not possible in the built-in function) so i used the value of (sqrt(2)-1) till 100th place from google, and I completed the problem</p>
